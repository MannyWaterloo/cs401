<p>Jesse Jackson? Do you even... ah, I see you have a telephone at least. You know that blinking thing
I've been calling you on? I will break this, I will BREAK THIS. Damn druggie idiot. Is this what
you've been doing the whole time I've been trying to reach you? </p>

<p>The game has changed. The word is out. And you... are a killer. Apparently it's all over town.
Somebody crossed you, you got angry, you crushed their skull with an ATM machine. Who cares! Just
as long as it's our competitors who believe it and not the police. </p>

<p>Don't you see how great this is? You, you are a... Jesse look at me. You... are a blowfish. A
 blowfish! Think about it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators
 but the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't he. Doesn't he? What does the blowfish do, Jesse.
 What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up, okay? </p>

<p>The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and why? Why does he do that?
So that it makes him intimidating, that's why. Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are
scared off. And that's you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see it's...
it's nothing but air. Now... who messes with the blowfish, Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish.
Say it again. Say it like you mean it. You're a BLOWFISH! </p>
